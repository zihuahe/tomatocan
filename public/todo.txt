Teaching & Learning Ruby in a Post-University World

Today Ruby shops lament the lack of skilled job candidates. There are lots of online resources that aspiring rubyists can access to teach themselves Ruby, however most (especially young) people don't have much life context or engineering experience to help them guage what is important to work on and what leads them down a path of weeds. 

This is where structured coursework typically comes in, but few universities have faculty with Ruby skills. During my 12 years of university education, I felt that academic exercises that were thrown out at the end of the semester were a poor use of time compared to work that would actually be used in real world applications. Coursework did not result in knowledge of how the skills would be used in a real project and internships required learning new skills sets.

Instead of developing coursework filled with toy programming exercises, the Ruby community should grow new talent by working with aspiring Rubyists - who have demonstrated initiative - to develop real life practical business applications. The difference between academic exercises and live Ruby projects is that there is _context_ that helps students remember skills and it teaches them judgement skills to help them make decisions about what needs to be worked on and what does not.

Dr. Schaefer will use CrowdPublish.TV code to show an example of the thought processes required for building useful software vs. what happens when you learn via toy applications. 




Lisa Schaefer is the Founder & Software Engineer of CrowdPublish.TV, a platform for authors to crowdfund, publicize, and sell through their networks. Dr. Schaefer earned her Ph.D. in systems engineering from Arizona State University. She has taught engineering and statistics courses at Scottsdale Community College, ASU, Marymount, and American Universities. She taught herself Ruby on Rails via online resources, then developed and taught a course for George Mason University, and now teacher her own course. Dr. Schaefer has been a guest and a host on several Fairfax County cable shows and is the writer/producer of Budget Justified: The Waste, Fraud, & Abuse of Government Workers, about her experiences as a contractor working in FAA offices and Lisa's 80s Catholic High School Movie - math girl versus class clown twin brothers.
